    <!-- Introductory Paragraph -->
    <section class="container">
        <p>Artificial intelligence is transforming industries and reshaping economies, but its energy consumption is raising serious concerns. AI models require vast amounts of computational power to operate, often relying on energy-intensive data centers that consume significant electricity. Not all AI tasks are created equal—some, like image generation, are far more energy-intensive than simpler tasks like text classification. Geographically, these impacts also vary depending on regional energy sources and infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>HuggingFace's AI Energy Score aims to provide clarity in this complex landscape by systematically testing hundreds of models across various tasks. By offering a standardized framework for measuring energy efficiency, it seeks to empower developers and policymakers to make informed decisions about sustainable AI deployment while considering the broader implications for energy systems worldwide.</p>

    <!-- Task Energy Consumption Chart -->
    <section class="container">
        <h2>Energy Consumption Per Task</h2>
        <div class="responsive-chart" style="text-align:center;"> <!-- Centered chart -->
            <object data="task_energy_df.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
        </div>
        <p>The chart above illustrates the average energy consumption across ten common AI tasks. Image generation tasks stand out as particularly energy-intensive due to their reliance on large-scale models like Stable Diffusion, while binary text classification consumes minimal energy. These differences highlight the need for tailored approaches to optimizing AI energy use.</p>

    <!-- Most Efficient Models -->
    <section class="container side-by-side">
        <div>
            <h2>Top 5 Most Energy-Efficient Models</h2>

        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <p>
                
                The most energy-efficient models include distilgpt2, opt-125m, and gpt2-medium. These models consume minimal GPU energy while maintaining high performance. Distilgpt2 is particularly noteworthy for its compact architecture, making it ideal for lightweight applications.</p>
            
            <p>These results demonstrate how optimization can reduce energy costs without sacrificing functionality—a crucial step toward sustainable AI development.</p>

    <!-- Least Efficient Models -->
    <section class="container side-by-side">
        <div>
            <h2>Top 5 Least Energy-Efficient Models</h2>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <p>
                
                The least energy-efficient models include phi-4 and Llama-2-13b-hf. These models consume significantly more GPU energy due to their large size and computational intensity.</p>

            <p>While these models excel at complex tasks like image generation or reasoning, their environmental impact is substantial. Developers must weigh these trade-offs when choosing models for specific applications.</p>

    <!-- Analysis of Models -->
    <section class="container">
        <h2>What Do These Results Tell Us?</h2>
        <p>The comparison between efficient and inefficient models highlights the diversity in AI technologies. Smaller models are optimized for efficiency and accessibility, while larger models prioritize performance at a higher energy cost. Policymakers in both tech and energy sectors should consider these intricacies when crafting regulations or frameworks for sustainable AI development.</p>

        <p><strong>Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADPe):</strong> This metric measures the depletion of non-renewable resources like minerals and metals during electricity production. The USA leads in ADPe due to its reliance on fossil fuels, while France ranks lowest thanks to its nuclear-powered grid.</p>

    <section class="container">
        <p><strong>Primary Energy Consumption (PE):</strong> PE represents the total amount of energy required to produce one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity. China has the highest PE value due to its coal-heavy power mix, while France benefits from more efficient nuclear energy production.</p>
        <p>The chart above highlights regional differences in electricity generation methods and their environmental impacts. China’s coal-heavy power mix results in higher primary energy consumption compared to France’s reliance on nuclear power, which is more efficient and less resource-intensive.</p>
