    <!-- Introductory Paragraph -->
    <section class="container">
        <p>Artificial intelligence is transforming industries, but its energy consumption is raising serious concerns. AI models require vast amounts of computational power to operate, often relying on energy-intensive data centers. This has led to growing scrutiny over the environmental impact of AI technologies, especially as global energy demand continues to rise.</p>
        
        <p>HuggingFace's AI Energy Score aims to address this issue by providing a standardized framework to measure and compare the energy efficiency of AI models. By testing hundreds of models across various tasks, HuggingFace hopes to guide developers and organizations toward more sustainable choices in AI deployment.</p>

    <!-- Task Energy Consumption Chart -->
    <section class="container">
        <h2>Energy Consumption Per Task</h2>
        <div class="responsive-chart" style="text-align:center;"> <!-- Centered chart -->
            <object data="task_energy_df.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
        </div>
        <p>The chart above illustrates the average energy consumption across ten common AI tasks. Image generation tasks stand out as particularly energy-intensive due to their reliance on large-scale models like Stable Diffusion, while binary text classification consumes minimal energy.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Most Efficient Models -->
    <section class="container side-by-side">

        <div class="text-box">
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The most energy-efficient models include distilgpt2, opt-125m, and gpt2-medium. These models consume minimal GPU energy while maintaining high performance. Distilgpt2 is particularly noteworthy for its compact architecture, making it ideal for lightweight applications.</p>
            
            <p>These models demonstrate how optimization can reduce energy costs without sacrificing functionality—a crucial step toward sustainable AI development.</p>

            <object data="least_efficient_models.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The least energy-efficient models include phi-4 and Llama-2-13b-hf. These models consume significantly more GPU energy due to their large size and computational intensity.</p>

            <p>While these models excel at complex tasks like image generation or reasoning, their environmental impact is substantial. Developers must weigh these trade-offs when choosing models for specific applications.</p>
        </div>

    <!-- Analysis of Models -->
    <section class="container">
        <h2>What Do These Results Tell Us?</h2>
        <p>The comparison between efficient and inefficient models highlights the diversity in AI technologies. Smaller models are optimized for efficiency and accessibility, while larger models prioritize performance at a higher energy cost. This raises questions about how organizations can balance functionality with sustainability in their AI strategies.</p>

    <!-- Explanation of Environmental Impacts -->
    <section class="container">
        <p><strong>Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADPe):</strong> This metric measures the depletion of non-renewable resources like minerals and metals during electricity production. The USA leads in ADPe due to its reliance on fossil fuels, while France ranks lowest thanks to its nuclear-powered grid.</p>

        <p><strong>Primary Energy Consumption (PE):</strong> PE represents the total amount of energy required to produce one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity. China has the highest PE value due to its coal-heavy power mix, while France benefits from more efficient nuclear energy production.</p>
